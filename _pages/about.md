<div style="text-align: justify"> 
I am a fourth-year PhD student at Ghent University of Belgium, working under Professor Wesley De Neve and Professor Van Messem. Due to my teaching duties, I am mostly located in the South Korean campus of Ghent University. I will receive my doctoral degree on January 2022. During my PhD, I tacked the problem of trustable AI, analyzing weaknesses of deep learning models against negative adversarial examples.


My most recent works include (1) a sanity check to adversarial attack evaluation in context of misclassification classes and the selection of source images, (2) adversarial attacks on segmentation models, and (3) plausable defenses against adversarial examples. 

I obtained my MSc. Data Science degree from University of Southampton (UK) in 2017 and BSc. Computer Engineering degree from Yasar University (Turkey) in 2014. In between MSc. and BSc. I worked as an SAP Business Intelligence Consultant for two years, visiting various companies and solving their BI needs.

In terms of research, I am generally interested in:

* Trustable AI
* Adversarial examples (properties, attacks, and defenses)
* Real-world applications (attacks) of adversarial examples
* Explainable AI
* Out-of-distribution detection
* Robustness of deep learning models
