<div style="text-align: justify"> 
I am a fourth-year PhD student at Ghent University of Belgium, under Professor Wesley De Neve and Professor Van Messem. Due to my teaching duties, I am mostly located in South Korean campus of Ghent University. I will (hopefully) finish my PhD around December 2021. My most recent works include (1) adversarial attacks on segmentation models and (2) plausable defenses against adversarial examples. 

I obtained my MSc. Data Science degree from University of Southampton (UK) in 2017 and BSc. Computer Engineering degree from Yasar University (Turkey) in 2014. In between MSc. and BSc. I worked as an SAP Business Intelligence Consultant for two years, visiting various companies and solving their BI needs.

In terms of research, I am generally interested in:

* Adversarial examples (properties, attacks, and defenses)
* Real-world applications (attacks) of adversarial examples
* Explainable AI
* Out-of-distribution detection
* Model robustness
