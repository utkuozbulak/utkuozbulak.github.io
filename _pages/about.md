Currently working as a postdoctoral researcher at the Korean Campus of Ghent University, where I am engaged in research on two distinct topics: (1) image-based self-supervised learning, particularly with vision transformers, and (2) the exploration of a combination of machine learning and mutagenesis in human DNA.
  
Here is an overview of my recent activities:
