<div style="text-align: justify"> I am a third-year PhD student at Ghent University of Belgium, working on the topic of adversarial examples and model interpretability in deep learning. However, due to my teaching duties, I am mostly located in South Korea. My most recent works include (1) adversarial attacks on segmentation models and (2) plausable defenses against adversarial examples. I obtained my MSc. Data Science degree from University of Southampton (UK) in 2017 and BSc. Computer Engineering degree from Yasar University (Turkey) in 2014. In between MSc. and BSc. I worked as an SAP Business Intelligence Consultant for two years, visiting various companies and solving their BI needs.

In terms of research, I am generally interested in:

* Adversarial examples (properties, attacks, and defenses)
* Real-world applications (attacks) of adversarial examples
* Deep learning model interpretability
* Out-of-distribution detection
